Plant Disease Recognition App
Theme: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

About the idea Problem: Farmers in India spend crores of rupees on disease management, often without adequate technical support, resulting in poor disease control, pollution and harmful results. In addition, plant diseases can devastate natural ecosystems, compounding environmental problems caused by habitat loss and poor land management. Moreover, lack of awareness regarding the efficient farming techniques and about the Govt. inititiatives is aggregating to the miserable state of farmers.

Objective: To create a simple mobile application that'll enable users, specifically farmers, to recognize diseased plants and stay updated with farming practices.

Implementation: The idea is being implemented using following steps:

First, we train our ML model on a dataset consisting of pictures of leaves of plants in different stages - healthy and diseased.
Our mobile application will enable the user to upload the picture of a plant's leaves to test for diseases.
Our application will specify whether a plant is suffering from a disease based on the findings of our trained model.
In case, an early indication of a disease is spotted, our application will recommend appropriate measures to the user to curb it.
Our application updates the farmer of newly implemented Govt schemes, initiatives and further proceeds.
It also sends daily farming tips and tricks to educate the farmer of various farming approaches and procedures.
Tech Stack:

Deep Learning Frameworks such as Keras/TensorFlow to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Quintessential Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc.

Conclusion: That was our simple solution based on a very basic idea, looking to bring about a small but signicant change in the agricultural industry, the heart of Third World countries like India.
